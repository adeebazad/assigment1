    "Q1- who developed the python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1- Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2- Which type of Programming does Python support? \n",
    "\n",
    " Ans-2 Python supports multiple programming paradigms including:\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Imperative programming\n",
    "Functional programming\n",
    "Procedural programming\n",
    "Reflective programming\n",
    "Python is often referred to as a multi-paradigm programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3- Is Python case sensitive when dealing with Identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans-3 Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers \n",
    " (e.g. variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
    " For example, myData and mydata are treated as two different identifiers in Python.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4- What Is the correct extension of the Python flle?\n",
    "\n",
    " Ans4- The correct extension for a Python file is .py. Python files typically use this extension and it is the standard file extension used for Python source code.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Q5-Is Python code compiled or Interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5- Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. This means that the source code is executed line by line, at runtime, by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code ahead of time, which is executed directly by the computer's hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6-Name a few blocks of code used to define In Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6- In Python, a few blocks of code used to define a code structure are:\n",
    "Functions: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n",
    "Conditional blocks: Conditional blocks are used to execute a certain piece of code only if a certain condition is met. In Python, this is typically done using an if statement. For example, you can check if a certain variable is equal to a specific value, and execute a block of code if the condition is true.\n",
    "Loops: Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Python provides two types of loops: for loops and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7-State a character used to give slngle - line comments In Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans7-  character # is used to give single-line comments. Everything written after the # symbol on a line is ignored by the interpreter, \n",
    "\n",
    "\"#This is a single-line comment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8-Mention functions Which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans8-In Python, you can use the following functions to find the version of Python you are currently working with:\n",
    "sys.version: This returns a string that provides information about the version of Python, as well as other details about the system and environment.\n",
    "sys.version_info: This returns a named tuple that provides more detailed information about the version of Python. The named tuple has several attributes, including major, minor, micro, releaselevel, and serial.\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "print(sys.version_info)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9-Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans9- \"lambda functions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10- What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans10- \"pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\". It is a package management system for Python, used to install and manage packages and libraries needed for a Python application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11- Mention a few built-ln functions In python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans11-1-print(): This function is used to display text or the value of a variable on the screen.\n",
    "2-len(): This function returns the length of a string, list, or other sequence.\n",
    "3-range(): This function generates a sequence of numbers, and is often used in for loops.\n",
    "4- str(): This function converts a value to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12- What Is the maximum possible length of an Identifier In Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans12- there is a practical limit imposed by the underlying operating system, which determines the maximum length of a file name or a variable name. On most modern operating systems, this limit is typically between 255 and 32767 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13- What are the benefits of using Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans13-\n",
    "1-Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use, even for people with no prior programming experience.\n",
    "2-Versatile and Cross-platform: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, \n",
    "3-Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line-by-line, rather than being compiled. This makes it easier to debug and test your code.\n",
    "4-Large Standard Library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library, which includes modules for a wide range of tasks, such as file I/O, regular expressions, and more. This makes it easy to perform common programming tasks without having to write additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14-How Is memory managed In Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans14-\n",
    "In Python, memory management is performed automatically and transparently by the Python interpreter. The Python memory manager manages the memory used by the Python objects and provides several services, such as allocating memory, freeing memory, and moving objects in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15-How to Install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans15- To set the path variables, we will need to update the system environment variables.\n",
    "To do this,these steps:\n",
    "Press the Windows key and the X key at the same time.\n",
    "Select \"System.\"\n",
    "Click on \"Advanced system settings.\"\n",
    "Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "Under \"System Variables,\" scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable.\n",
    "Click on the \"Edit\" button.\n",
    "Click on the \"New\" button and add the path to the Python installation, for example: C:\\Python38\\.\n",
    "Click \"OK\" to close all the windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16-Is Indentation required In python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans16-Indentation is used to indicate the level of nested code, with each level of indentation indicating a deeper level of nesting. For example, the body of a for loop might be indented one level, and the code inside an if statement inside that loop might be indented another level."
