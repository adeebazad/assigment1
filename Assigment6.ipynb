    "Class and Object are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",

    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which can contain properties (data) and methods (functions). It acts as a blueprint for objects, defining the data and behavior of all objects created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class, created at runtime. It has its own properties and methods, which can be accessed and manipulated. An object can be thought of as a specific occurrence of a class, with its own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a class \"Car\". The class \"Car\" could have properties such as make, model, year, color, etc. The class \"Car\" could also have methods such as start(), stop(), drive(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can create objects from the class \"Car\", for example, \"sedan\", \"SUV\", \"hatchback\", etc. Each object will have its own values for properties like make, model, year, color, etc. and can perform the actions defined in the class methods."

    "Encapsulation: It is the mechanism of wrapping the data (attributes) and the functions (methods) operating on the data within the same unit.\n",
